# forest-fire-detection-system
This project utilizes 🔬 machine learning algorithms to predict 🔥 forest fires using inputs such as 🌡️ temperature, 🧪 oxygen level, and 💧 humidity. The trained model can analyze the inputs and provide a prediction of the likelihood of a forest fire occurring. The prediction results are displayed through a 🌐 Flask web application.
